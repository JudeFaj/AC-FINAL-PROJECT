## Introduction
(Brief overview of the project, its purpose, and the importance of cryptography)

## Project Objectives
(List at least 3 specific objectives your project aims to achieve)

## Discussions
(Describe the overall application architecture and UI choice.)

(For each implemented cryptographic algorithm: Name and type (Symmetric/Asymmetric/Hash) as well as Brief history/background)

(Description of the process/how it works (can be high-level or include simplified pseudocode)

(Libraries used for its implementation)

(How it's integrated into your application)

## Sample Runs and Outputs
Include screen snippets (screenshots) or text-based output examples for each algorithm's functionality (encryption, decryption, hashing for both text and files where applicable).

Embed images directly in the README.md or link to them within the repository. Use Markdown code blocks for text output.

Example:

Python Code:
```Python
print("hello")
```

```
This is just text in a code block
```
